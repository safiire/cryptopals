# Cryptopals

This is my code for solving the [Cryptopals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/). The project is formatted and tested as a Rubygem.

You'll find the actual code in [lib/cryptopals](https://github.com/safiire/cryptopals/tree/master/lib/cryptopals) directory.

Specs are in [/specs](https://github.com/safiire/cryptopals/tree/master/spec)
